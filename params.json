  "body": "**Nicodemus** is a teacher of Judaism and a member of the Jewish ruling council in the 1st century. He visited Jesus at night and asked about eternal life.\r\n\r\nHere in Shenzhen, China, we found that most of our colleagues are just like Nicodemus. They seek for religions by themselves, and they don't want others to know. So that some of our Brothers and Sisters in this software company, set up a club and name it the Nicodemus Club. We organize events regularly to introduce Jesus Christ to our coworkers, and hope we can bring them the truth, and help them to know the right way to eternity, and experience the abundant life.\r\n\r\nThe club officially started at Apr. 2005. Actually the Brothers and Sisters began gathering from year 2002. This year is also the founding year of this software company. Now the company has been written off, but Nicodemus Club is still keeping gathering, to share the experience of life, to discuss the meaning of life, and to spread the good news from Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n",
